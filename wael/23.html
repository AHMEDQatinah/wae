            Black Clover might be in the middle of a major hiatus as the series creator prepares for the final arc of the series,
             and now one awesome cosplay is filling the gap by putting Vanessa Enoteca
              back into the spotlight! The anime run came to an end last year,
              and now the manga is getting ready to do the same a year
               later as series creator Yuki Tabata has officially gone
               on a lengthy hiatus in order to ready everything for the 
               final arc of the series to come. That means fans are now counting down the
                days until it all comes to an end.

                When we had last seen the members of the Black Bulls squad, they had managed to barely survive one
                 of the toughest fights in the series to date as
                  they took on the three top devils of the underworld in a
                  huge war. But with the final arc revealing that
                   there's still one major villain to take care of (one that they
                   are all very close to), it's hard to guess what
                    will happen to each of them. Now artist @maywedacosplay is showing 
                   off one of these Black Bulls members in particular
                    with an awesome cosplay for Vanessa Enoteca! Check it out below:
