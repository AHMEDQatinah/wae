    <p>Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather
      instills two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's friends at
      the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which Yuji swallowed to
      protect Megumi Fushiguro and their friends, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's
      evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and by extension, Yuji) immediately. But upon seeing Yuji
      retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High
      School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all
      of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be completely destroyed. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a
      multi-layered attack on the world of jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed spirit Mahito and a sorcerer named
      Suguru Geto, who was "killed" by Gojo a year prior. At the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu
      schools, the Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately, while others side with Gojo to keep Yuji alive.
      Gojo and Geto failed to protect a young girl from Toji Fushiguro, Megumi's father, an assassin from the Zenin
      clan. Geto decides the world must be cleansed of non-sorcerers so no more Cursed spirits can manifest.</p>
